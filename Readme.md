Building a NFT collection with metadat stored on IPFS using **_React.js_**,**_Next.js_**,**_Ether.js_**,**_Hardhat_**,**_ERC721_** and **_Metamask_**.

IPFS stands for the InterPlanetary File System. It is a distributed, peer to peer network, for storing and sharing files, websites, applications, etc

What is a **_Non-Fungible Token_**? Fungible means to be the same or interchangeable eg. Eth is fungible. With this in mind, NFTs are unique; each one is different. Every single token has unique characteristics and values. They are all distinguishable from one another and are not interchangeable eg Unique Art.

What is **_ERC-721_**? ERC-721 is an open standard that describes how to build Non-Fungible tokens on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains; it is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens; it has a set of rules which make it easy to work with NFTs
