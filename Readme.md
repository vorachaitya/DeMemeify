#### Problem Statement
- Many meme lovers like a meme so much that they are excited and eager to buy that meme and claim to be the owner of that meme. But there are hadly any platforms,wherein they can buy memes and be the owner. 

#### Our Solution
- Thus to help those meme lovers,we have created a decentralised platform-**[MemeKart](https://meme-kart-vorachaitya.vercel.app/)** where they can mint a NFT(Non-Fungible Token) for thier liked meme just by paying a nominal fee.
- After this,thier meme becomes unique. Also,the meme would become immutable and be availabe on the peers of the blockchain network thus ensuring high security. Now,they can easily showcase being the owner of that meme in front of other people and brag themselves.

#### Features

1. Meme Lover can mint only 1 meme NFT with one transaction.
2. They have to pay a transaction fee of 0.1 ether to mint a meme.
2. There exists only 5 meme NFT's which are unique.
3. The metadata for the NFT's is stored on IPFS(Inter-planetary File System)
4. The NFT contract is deployed on Goerli Test Network.
5. For time being,we have made MemeKart a static platform.
